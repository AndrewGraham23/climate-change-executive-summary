## Introduction
The current climate crisis has resulted in devastating impacts ranging from increased frequencies of extreme weather events to compositional changes in Earth’s atmosphere (Frumkin, 2022). As irreversible damage approaches, these effects should be investigated, focusing on the direct effects of climate change on air quality, and its disproportionate impacts on child health.

## Air Quality
In this context, two main air pollutants are of primary concern: ozone and particulate matter (PM). Ozone is produced through chemical reactions involving carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), with increased production at higher temperatures (Figure 1). PM consists of many compounds, with sulphate, nitrate, and elemental carbon in particular posing issues to human health (Harrison and Yin, 2000). Additionally, the meteorological alterations in a changing climate can concentrate pollutants in certain areas.

*Figure 1: This diagram illustrates the production of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from NMVOC, and the interplay between various gases in the atmosphere. When NMVOCs are introduced into the system, they react with hydroxyl radicals (OH) to produce an organic oxygen-containing species (RO<sub>2</sub>). The RO<sub>2</sub> species reacts with atmospheric nitrogen monoxide (NO) to produce nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and RO. Once NO<sub>2</sub> comes into contact with heat energy from the sun’s rays, an oxygen radical is released which, when exposed to atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub>, produces O<sub>3</sub>.

## Air Pollution and Human Health
A major issue when considering increasing air pollution and declining air quality is the effect on human health. Increasing concentrations of pollutants like PM and ozone are associated with the onset of various physiological ailments, and the exacerbation of numerous pre-existing conditions (Manisalidis et al., 2020). For instance, chronic exposure to PM can result in the development of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, such as asthma or bronchitis (Emel Önal, 2022). Inhalation of ozone can cause inflammation and irritation of the respiratory tract, and its water solubility allows it to penetrate tissue, potentially leading to  mutations in the cells, and resulting in cancers.
## The Disproportionate Impacts on Children

Children are at greater risk of adverse health effects from poor air quality since they spend more time outside than adults, inhale more pollutants due to their faster breathing rates, and have more susceptible developing body systems (Suwanwaiphatthana, Ruangdej and Turner-Henson, 2010). Exposure to poor quality has been shown to increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, frequency of hospitalisation, and even death in children (Rodriguez et al., 2007; Jans, Johansson and Nilsson, 2018). This can have consequences well into adulthood, from poor educational outcomes to harms to productivity (Marcotte, 2017; Jans, Johansson and Nilsson, 2018). Social determinants (Figure 2), such as race and socioeconomic status, result in disproportionate impacts from these effects. This includes those from low-income and racialized backgrounds, deterring them from accessing the care that they need (Landrigan, Rauh and Galvez, 2010; Patel et al., 2021).

## Considerations and Recommendations
Despite air pollution being a worldwide problem, different geographic regions are disproportionately affected. Countries where rapid urbanization has occurred and government regulations are poorly established or enforced, experience particularly poor air quality and associated health outcomes (Garaga, Sahu and Kota, 2018). For example, air pollution from PM and various industrial sources is a serious health concern in India and China (Li et al., 2016). While a universal solution to climate change and its effects on air quality proves difficult due to disagreements and differences in policy, mitigation measures like the use of face masks or respirators can be used.
## Conclusion
Increasing global temperatures due to climate change have an undeniable effect on air quality, which disproportionately affects the health of children. Pollutants especially affect children living in cities, those part of lower socioeconomic classes and minority groups, and those living in developing regions of the world. Given these considerations, the health of children should be a priority when addressing climate change.
